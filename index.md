 I am a second-year master student in LIESMARS at Wuhan University, China. Before that, I received my B.Eng degree in [Geomatics Engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomatics) from Wuhan University. My research interests include machine learning and its application in structured deep models (e.g. mining graph-structured data, spatiotemporal time series).
